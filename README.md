# Buggy CryptoTigers

### Introduction

You proved your understanding of Smart Contracts, time to test out your security knowledge!

Take a look at the provided file `contracts/TigerBuggyNFT.sol`, which contains an implementation of the already discussed CryptoTigers requirements. However, as it's name implies, this contract has a number of defects and vulnerabilities.

- First, run `npm i` to install the hardhat dependencies
- This can be seen if the accompanying tests are run via `npx hardhat test`, as a number of the tests fail.
  - Try to get the failing tests to pass by fixing the defects in the contract.
  - Be warned that the contract contains some defects that are not detected by the tests. There are 8 defects in all, some of which could result in users losing their funds. See how many you can find and fix.


Once you have completed the project, let us know in the #prework Discord channel. We will provide a list with descriptions of all the defects, so you can see how well you did finding them all.
